  <h3>Step 2</h3>
  <p class="lead">Harness the power of utility classes!</p>
  <p>
    It follows utility-first fundamentals, where you apply pre-existing
    classes directly in your HTML.
  </p>
  <p>
    These utility classes can be seen as "helper functions" or as a stylization "API" from
    CSS.
  </p>
  <p>
    You combine these classes together to compose complex and unique
    designs without having to write actual CSS.
    
    <p> Each class is purpose-specific from a constrained set for spacing (margin/padding), sizing (width/height), fonts, colors, backgrounds, borders, display (flex/grid), and much more! </p>
